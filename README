NAME
    Plack::Middleware::SetEnvFromHeader - Set environment variables from the
    values of request headers

SYNOPSIS
        # in app.psgi
        use Plack::Builder;

        builder {
            enable 'SetEnvFromHeader' =>
                REMOTE_USER => "X-Proxy-REMOTE-USER";
            $app;
        };

        # with plackup
        plackup -e 'enable SetEnvFromHeader => REMOTE_USER => "X-Testing-User"' app.psgi

DESCRIPTION
    SetEnvFromHeader modifies the environment passed to the application by
    adding your specified keys with the values pulled from the request
    header.

    This is primarily useful when testing apps under plackup (or similar) in
    a development environment.

    It may also be desireable in production to provide standard environment
    values via non-standard headers, but if you're using this for
    security-sensitive values like "REMOTE_USER" make sure no one can make
    direct requests to your backend!
